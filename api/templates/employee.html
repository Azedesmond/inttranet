        <h1>Employee Page</h1>
        <p>On the company platform, employees can register information related to suppliers, customers, and products. Employees can also record the various transactions carried out with a customer or supplier. Each operation is recorded for better traceability. Employees can communicate on the platform via a chatbox, and tasks (a task has a textual description, a creator, a performer, and its status: assigned, unassigned, completed) can be assigned to employees by an employee category with a high privilege level. The management of platform users must be meticulously ensured with well-defined privilege levels.</p>
